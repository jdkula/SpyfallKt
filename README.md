# SpyfallKt
I'm trying out creating a Spyfall clone using Kotlin.

I'm using Kotlin + React for the frontend, Ktor for the backend, and Websockets for communication.

Still alpha -- the game works, but there are definetly bugs and the code is still very messy (I'll be cleaning it up soon).

Heavily based on https://github.com/mpcovcd/spyfall!

Spyfall is a game designed by Alexandr Ushan and published by Hobby World. This project was designed with no collaboration with nor was endorsed by either the designer or the publisher.
