# SpyfallKt
I'm trying out creating a Spyfall clone using Kotlin.

It'll use REST for some initial talking to the server, and use WebSockets for the game itself. The backend runs on Ktor, and the frontend will use mostly vanilla JS.
This is hyper-pre-alpha. It'll probably change all over the place, and definetly isn't working yet (or really documented at all). I'm not really 100% sure what I'm doing yet... it's mostly just a project to get more proficient with Kotlin n' stuff.
